# **Credit Risk Analysis**

## **Overview**

The purpose of this analysis is to predict credit risk for client LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, by using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate resampling and ensemble classifiers models.

## **Results**

Six machine learning models were built using the 2019 Q1 Loan Statistics dataset. The results have been grouped below by resampling or ensemble classifier.

#### *Resampling Models Results:*

1. RandomOverSampler
  The balanced accuracy score was 0.6463970560994359 with precision scores of 0.01 for high_risk and 1.00 for low_risk and recall scores of 0.71 for high_risk and 0.58     for low_risk.

#### *Ensemble Classifiers Results:*

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## **Summary** 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
